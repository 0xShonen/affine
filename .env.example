# These are *names* (aliases) you assign when creating the coldkey and hotkey.
# You can create a new one for mining/validating like `btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name mywallet`
# Not the SS58 address or file path. Just the user-chosen wallet name.
# 1. BT_WALLET_COLD — the name you gave your coldkey (e.g., "mywallet")
# This key stays offline and is used for staking, registration, and ownership.
BT_WALLET_COLD=default

# 2. BT_WALLET_HOT — the name you gave your hotkey (e.g., "myhotkey")
# You can create a new one `btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey myhotkey`
# Note that mywallet here is the same from the previous set.
# This key is safe to use online and used for mining, validation, or inference.

# CHUTE_USER:
# ➤ Your Chutes username.
# ➤ Set during `chutes register` (usually matches your Bittensor hotkey name).
# ➤ Used to identify your account on the Chutes platform.

# 2. HF_TOKEN: Your personal access token
# ➤ Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# ➤ Click "New token"
# ➤ Name it (e.g., "affine-miner") and select `Write` scope
# ➤ Copy the token shown — starts with `hf_...`

# AFFINE_FORCE_UID0 controls how much weight is forced to UID 0 (interpreted as a float).
#   - = 1.0 : full force — UID 0 receives 100% of the weight.
#   - 0.0 < x < 1.0 : partial burn — assign fraction x to UID 0; scale the remaining (1 - x)
#                     across eligible miners (their weights are multiplied by (1 - x)).
#   - 0.0 : no burn — normal weight distribution among eligible miners.
# Example:
AFFINE_FORCE_UID0="0"   # no burn: validator distributes weights normally
# Other examples:
# AFFINE_FORCE_UID0="0.2"  # burn 20% to UID 0, distribute 80% among eligibles
# AFFINE_FORCE_UID0="1.0"  # force UID 0 to receive all weight
